# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express back-end skills.

## Getting Started

git clone https://github.com/harry-th/tweeter

npm install

npm run local for nodemon or npm start

I think the animation for a new tweet is rather good.
